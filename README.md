# AirAware
Developing an Algorithm for Air Quality Visualizer and Forecast WebApp to generate granular, real-time, and predictive air quality information

## 1. Introduction
AirAware is a cloud-native platform designed to monitor and forecast **air quality (AQI)** and **weather patterns** across multiple Indian cities. The project provides real-time insights, predictive analytics, and an interactive web interface to help individuals, organizations, and policymakers make data-driven environmental decisions.

## 2. Project Overview
- üì° **Data Ingestion:** Automated ETL pipeline fetching AQI and weather data from multiple public APIs.  
- üìä **Data Processing & Storage:** Structured storage in AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) and raw data in S3 for durability.  
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Time-series forecasting model for predicting AQI trends.  
  - Anomaly detection model for identifying unusual pollution spikes.  
- üåê **Web Interface:** Lightweight frontend built using **FastAPI + HTML + CSS**, serving both API endpoints and visual dashboards.  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Scalability:** Built with serverless components (Lambda, NAT Gateway, S3) to handle **50k+ daily records** and scale automatically with demand.
